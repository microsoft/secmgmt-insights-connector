# Security and Management Insights Connector

Microsoft 365 provides several advanced security and management features that empower you to improve your, or your customers, security posture. Knowing what features are configured and whether they adhere to the recommended configurations is challenging. Using this connector, you will be able gain insights what components have been adopted and how they are configured.  

To get started with this connect check out the [getting started](https://github.com/microsoft/secmgmt-insights-connector/wiki/getting-started) section of the wiki.

## Architecture

Most of the information required to understand what is configured and the current settings is obtained using Microsoft Graph. However, there is some data that is currently only available through Exchange Online PowerShell. Considering this two Power BI connectors were built for this solution. The `SecMgmtInsights` connector communicates directly with Microsoft Graph and can gather configuration and usage information. Through the `SecMgmtInsights.PowerShell` connector Office 365 ATP information from Exchange Online PowerShell is exposed through an Azure Functions app.
